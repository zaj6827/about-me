# about-me
My "About Me" page for code 201.
On the 8th of June, 2017, I, Zachary Johnson, was the navigator
on this code. Maddy Stevens was my Driver. Together, we accomplished greatness. We did get a little bit ahead of ourselves, and didn't add,
commit, and push after each question. Instead, we jammed out the code, tested each question independently, and then tested the code as a whole.
Everything worked! We added, committed, and pushed. Then I brought it down to my local terminal. Everything worked out.
